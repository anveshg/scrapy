Scrapy 
======
**Scrapy** is a script in python for scraping webpages. Also, this is my first script with Python and BeautifulSoup to help with a web audit project.

Kindly note that the code may not be perfect as this was built while learning BeautifulSoup, File handling and a lot more of Python.

**What I Learnt From This**
  * Capture URLs within HTML tags by class, id and other attributes
  * Reading and Writing to files
  * Measuring Code Execution Time

*p.s I <3 Python!*
