Scrapy Jr. and Sr.
======
**Scrapy** is a script in python for scraping webpages. Also, this is my first script with Python and BeautifulSoup to help with a web audit project.

Kindly note that the code may not be perfect as this was built while learning BeautifulSoup, File handling and a lot more of Python.

**What I Learnt From This**
  * Capture URLs within HTML tags by class, id and other attributes
  * Reading and Writing to files
  * Measuring Code Execution Time

*p.s I <3 Python!*

##The Scripts
scrapy-jr is a very chatty script (read as Debug-Friendly) and scrapy-sr is a more serious (read as quiet and batch processing) script.


The scripts can be used like this:

**scrapy-sr**

Once a file called *urlbucket.txt* - a text file with a list of URLs to parse is ready, you can invoke the script in the following way

```
$ python scrapy-sr.py
 Output
```

**scrapy-jr**
```
$ python scrapy-jr.py <url - with http>
 Output
```
